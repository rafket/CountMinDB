- CountMin on SSD
- Different buffer types

1) Space Graphs for Each Buffer / CountMin Type
a) Buffered (getMem)
b) Unbuffered (getMem)

2) Update Time
a) testing updating time of different buffer types
b) updating directly

3) Point Query
a) compare query time of different buffers
b) full workload time with no buffer + with buffers

4) Inner Product Query
a) Hash Table-Hash Table, Tree-Tree, etc.
b) CountMin in SSD with each type of buffer
c) BufferedCountMin in SSD with each type of buffer
d) TIME PERMITTING: do HashTable-RawLog, Tree-RawLog, etc. 

Give advice on how often you should batch.
